<b>About the SHIELD Drive Science Center</b>,br.
The goal of our DRIVE Science Center (DSC) is to develop a predictive global model for the heliosphere, called SHIELD (Solar wind with Hydrogen Ion charge Exchange and Large-Scale Dynamics). The heliosphere is an immense shield that protects the solar system from harsh galactic radiation. This radiation affects both life on Earth and human space exploration. The heliosphere is a window into processes occurring in all other astrospheres. Understanding these processes enables predictions about the astrospheric conditions necessary to create habitable planets. Another important aspect of SHIELD is that we proposed to develop a multi-faceted outreach program to reach from K-12 all the way to faculty with the goal of training, recruiting and retaining under-represented populations in space plasma and in related fields of electrical and computer engineering.

This multi-institutional effort is headquartered at Boston University and has co-investigators and collaborators across a dozen other institutions.

DRIVE Science Centers are part of an integrated multi-agency initiative from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) and are a high-priority recommendation of the 2013 Committee on a Decadal Strategy for Solar and Space Physics.
